rough planning ahead

# overview:
a property management system for a properties firm, mainly focusing on leasing rooms for bachelors(1) but also leases whole apartments and houses(2).

they have been increasing the number of properties they are leasing and so its becoming harder and harder to manage everything.

titles:
1. [[Lease of beds for bachelors.]]
2. [[Lease of whole properties.]]
### Current way of operation:
lets start with the leasing of rooms or beds to individual bachelors(1), since it's the largest faction of the firm business model.

there are **caretakers** who are assigned to one or more apartment/house (we will call them properties)

the caretakers are responsible for collecting rent, handling new tenants, paying for any expenses. All of these are recorded in a physical notebook. A record of all tenants with information regarding their rent, date of entry and day of rent collection. this is the most important part that has a lot of complexities.

titles:
1. [[Collect rents]]
2. [[handle tenants]]
3. [[record expense]]

collecting of the rent can be either cash or bank, fully or partially, this is all recorded in the notebook

By the end of the month, all the caretakers gather for a meeting, where they transfer all the records in the notebook to a spreadsheet, thus generating a monthly report of revenue, expenses and other information of new tenants or removed tenants are also recorded in the excel sheet to reflect the changes.

The finances are then shared with the partners, each property is shared by partners while some are not.
the report must also include how much gross and net revenue/profit is shared for each partner for what properties.
