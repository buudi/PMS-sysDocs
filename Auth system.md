# Authentication and Authorization Service Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a standalone Authentication and Authorization Service using NestJS. The service will handle user registration, login, and provide role-based access control using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this project includes the development of API endpoints for user registration, login, and other user-related actions. The service will be responsible for generating and validating JWTs and enforcing role-based access control.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 User Registration

- Users should be able to register with the service by providing a unique username and a secure password.
- Implement validation for username and password input.
- Store user data securely in a database.

### 2.2 User Login

- Users should be able to log in with their registered credentials.
- Generate and return a JWT upon successful login.

### 2.3 JWT-Based Authentication

- Implement a service for generating and validating JWTs.
- Ensure that JWTs are used for secure authentication.

### 2.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Define roles for users (e.g., admin, user).
- Implement middleware for role-based access control to secure endpoints.

### 2.5 API Endpoints

- Define API endpoints for user registration, login, and other user-related actions.
- Secure sensitive endpoints with JWT-based authentication and RBAC middleware.

### 2.6 Password Hashing

- Hash user passwords securely using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

### 2.7 Token Expiry and Refresh (Optional)

- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms to enhance security.

### 2.8 User Profile Management (Optional)

- Allow users to update their profiles and change passwords.

### 2.9 Email Verification (Optional)

- Implement email verification for user registration.

### 2.10 OAuth Integration (Optional)

- Integrate OAuth providers for social login (e.g., Google, Facebook).

## 3. Security Considerations

### 3.1 Password Policy

- Define password policies to ensure strong and secure passwords.

### 3.2 Token Security

- Ensure that JWTs are securely generated, stored, and transmitted.

### 3.3 Logging and Monitoring

- Implement logging for critical actions and errors.
- Set up monitoring tools to track service performance.

## 4. Database Integration

### 4.1 Database Selection

- Integrate with a database of choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

### 4.2 Data Storage

- Store user data securely in the database.

## 5. Deployment

### 5.1 Cloud Platform

- Deploy the Authentication and Authorization Service to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Unit and Integration Tests

- Write unit tests for services and integration tests for controllers.
- Test user registration, login, JWT generation, and authorization.

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 API Documentation

- Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger.
- Document the usage of endpoints, expected request and response formats, and authentication requirements.

## 8. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

### 8.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## 9. Constraints

### 9.1 Time Constraints

- The project is expected to be completed within a specified time frame.

### 9.2 Technology Constraints

- Use NestJS for the development of the Authentication and Authorization Service.

## 10. Conclusion

This requirements document outlines the scope, features, security considerations, testing, and deployment details for the Authentication and Authorization Service project with NestJS. It serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team and stakeholders involved in the project.
