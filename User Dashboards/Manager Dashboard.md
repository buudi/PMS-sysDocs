When thinking of the manager dashboard I don't think displaying yearly/monthly stats in the main page is what the manager wants to see everyday, yearly/monthly stats will be very similar from a day-to-day basis and would only be necessary to view when it comes the time to generate the financial reports and distribute the revenue to the partners.

Instead I think the main page should contain a "Today's summary" where information that a manager would want to see on a daily basis are present, the question is, what info is needed on a daily basis?

Here are some that I think are a good choice:
1. Newly onboarded tenants
	- I think the manager would be interested to know when there is a newly onboarded tenant particularly:
		1. Who is the person?
		2. Which property?
		3. How much is the assigned rent?
		4. Length of Lease Stay
2. New payments recorded (rent records / expenses)
	- The manager would be interested to know what are the new payments recorded, who paid and the status of tenants debts on a day to day basis
3. New deposit requests
	 - The manager would be interested to know new deposit requests in order to review and ratify them to the main account.
		 - Who Deposited? (account name)
		 - How many transactions are deposited?
		 - What's the Sum amount of all transactions deposited?
		 - and a button to "Review & Ratify Deposit" to take the manager to the deposit review page.

Above are the "Today's summary" Section, other than that some good monthly statistics that are relevant to the day-to-day work are also needed:
1. Unpaid invoices (Number of invoices and Amount)
	- can be either unpaid invoice that hasn't reached its due date yet, unpaid late invoices which have crossed its due date and the outstanding invoice (i.e. invoices that are paid partially but not completed)
	- it's relevant to day to day work since its a responsibility to collect all rent and ensure the least amount of outstanding balance.
2. Occupancy Rate
	- percent of occupancy and number of vacant units with a button "View Vacant Units"
	- it's relevant since its a responsibility to ensure the highest percentage of occupancy
