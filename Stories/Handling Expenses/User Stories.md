## Actors in Handling of Expenses

**Caretaker:**
- as a caretaker, I want to be able to record expenses on my account, upload any attachment and write any notes, add expense category, date, and payee information.
- as a caretaker, I want to be able to request for deposit ratification from manager, after which if approved my account gets cleared.

**Manager:**
- as a manager I want to be able to review expenses when caretakers request for deposit ratification, where I can approve and clear the respective caretaker account.
- as a manager, I want to filter expenses by caretaker, category, or date.
- as a manager, I want to be able to see expenses in the financial reports.
